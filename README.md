Abstract:

The project titled "DISPUTE HAPPENED IN INDIA" seeks to examine historical data on conflicts across India, focusing on understanding their trends, causes, and outcomes. It aims to analyze different aspects of conflicts, including their types (such as political, social, and economic), their geographical spread, and their occurrence over time. The goal is to uncover significant insights into the factors that drive these conflicts. Furthermore, the analysis will explore the socio-economic repercussions of these conflicts, assessing their impact on areas like development, peace, and national security. The project will employ a range of statistical methods and visualization tools to uncover key patterns and correlations, which can provide valuable input for shaping policies and strategies for conflict resolution.

Approach for performing EDA: 

This project used Google Colab as the primary development environment to conduct Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) on a comprehensive conflict dataset. Colab offered a cloud-based, collaborative, and GPU-accelerated workspace that enabled efficient data processing and visualization.

1. Downloading packages and importing the dataset
2. Data Profiling (Descriptive Analysis)
3. Diagnosis analysis
4. Predictive analysis
5. Prescriptive Analysis
6. Pre-profiling
